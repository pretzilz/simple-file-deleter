simple-file-deleter
===================

A simple python file deleter with a tkinter GUI. This was my final project for my python class at Ripon College, in 2013. 
This program will be updated relatively sparsely from now on.

FEATURES:
- Deletes files with an extention of your choise
- Deletes files that were created before a specific date
- Has presets: deletes all documents, installers, etc.
- Deletes files that have a keyword in the filename

All parts of the program work on Windows. It is currently untested on other platforms.

Future Features:
- Add options for sending files to the recycle bin (Windows only)
- Add options for deleting files in sub-directories
